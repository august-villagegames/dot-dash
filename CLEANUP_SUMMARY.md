# Code Cleanup Summary - AppleScript Disabled

## Overview
All AppleScript-related functionality has been temporarily disabled due to automation permissions issues. The app now uses only the backspace + paste method for text expansion.

## Files Modified

### 1. `Dot-Dash/AppDelegate.swift`
**Changes Made:**
- Commented out `checkAppleEventsPermission()` method
- Commented out `forceAppleEventsPermissionCheck()` method  
- Commented out `triggerAppleEventsPermissionDialog()` method
- Commented out `showForceAppleEventsPermissionAlert()` method
- Commented out `showAppleEventsPermissionAlert()` method
- Commented out `installAppToApplications()` method
- Commented out `checkTCCDatabase()` method
- Commented out Apple Events permission checks in `applicationDidFinishLaunching()`
- Commented out Apple Events permission checks in `checkPermissionsAndStart()`
- Commented out Apple Events permission checks in `pollForPermissions()`

**TODO Comments Added:**
- All commented sections include TODO comments referencing `AUTOMATION_PERMISSIONS_ISSUE.md`

### 2. `Dot-Dash/TextExpansionController.swift`
**Changes Made:**
- Commented out `tryAppleScriptStrategy()` method
- Commented out `checkAppleEventsPermission()` method
- Commented out AppleScript strategy call in `expand()` method
- Kept backspace + paste strategy as primary method

**TODO Comments Added:**
- All commented sections include TODO comments referencing `AUTOMATION_PERMISSIONS_ISSUE.md`

## Current Functionality

### ✅ What Still Works:
- **Accessibility permissions** - App can monitor keyboard input
- **Text expansion** - Using backspace + paste method
- **Command detection** - Recognizes `.command` patterns
- **Persistence** - Saves and loads expansion rules
- **UI** - Command management interface

### ❌ What's Disabled:
- **AppleScript text replacement** - Most reliable method for rich text
- **Automation permission requests** - No longer prompts for Apple Events
- **TCC database checking** - No longer monitors permission state
- **Installation helpers** - No longer offers to install to Applications

## Text Expansion Strategy

### Current Method: Backspace + Paste
1. **Detect command** (e.g., `.sig`)
2. **Calculate backspaces** needed (command length - 1)
3. **Send backspace events** to delete the command
4. **Set replacement text** on pasteboard
5. **Send Cmd+V** to paste the replacement

### Advantages:
- ✅ Works without Apple Events permission
- ✅ Compatible with most applications
- ✅ Simple and reliable
- ✅ No complex permission requirements

### Limitations:
- ❌ May not work in password fields
- ❌ May not preserve rich text formatting
- ❌ May not work in some terminal applications
- ❌ Slightly less precise than AppleScript method

## Future Re-enablement Plan

### Phase 1: Resolve Permissions
1. **Notarize the app** using Apple Developer account
2. **Test on clean user account** to isolate issue
3. **Implement proper Apple Event timing** (user-initiated only)
4. **Add System Events integration** before Apple Events
5. **Test with specific app targets** instead of System Events

### Phase 2: Re-enable AppleScript
1. **Uncomment all AppleScript code** with proper error handling
2. **Add fallback to backspace method** if AppleScript fails
3. **Implement hybrid approach** (try AppleScript first, fallback to backspace)
4. **Add user preference** to choose expansion method

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. **Rich text support** via AppleScript (when permissions work)
2. **Advanced text manipulation** capabilities
3. **Cross-application compatibility** improvements

## Testing

### Current Test Cases:
- ✅ Basic text expansion (`.sig` → signature)
- ✅ Multi-line text expansion
- ✅ Special characters in replacement text
- ✅ Multiple commands in sequence
- ✅ App persistence across restarts

### Future Test Cases (when AppleScript re-enabled):
- Rich text formatting preservation
- Cross-application compatibility
- Password field handling
- Terminal application support

## Documentation Created

### 1. `AUTOMATION_PERMISSIONS_ISSUE.md`
- Comprehensive documentation of the automation permissions issue
- Details of what has been tried
- Root cause analysis
- Remaining solutions to try
- Technical notes and references

### 2. `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` (this file)
- Summary of code changes made
- Current functionality status
- Future re-enablement plan

## Next Steps

1. **Continue app development** using backspace + paste method
2. **Test and refine** text expansion functionality
3. **Add new features** that don't require Apple Events
4. **When ready to tackle permissions:**
   - Follow the plan in `AUTOMATION_PERMISSIONS_ISSUE.md`
   - Uncomment AppleScript code
   - Test with notarized app

## Notes

- All AppleScript code is preserved in comments
- TODO comments clearly mark what needs to be re-enabled
- Documentation provides clear path forward
- App remains fully functional with current method
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
